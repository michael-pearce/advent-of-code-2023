## Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an awesome series of daily challenges starting in December each year that test your skills in algorithmic thinking and data structures. They can be solved in any language, and are great for picking up a new language or practicing one you already know.

This year I'm excited to be trying out Rust -- mainly inspired by the Primeagen!
